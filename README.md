# Black-Scholes-Iron-Condor-Trading-Strategy

In this project, I try backtesting a trading strategy involving options. I used the Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value of each option. I then backtested an iron condor strategy which takes advantage of how the market often over-estimates volatility.

SKILLS: Python, Black Scholes, Data Analysis
